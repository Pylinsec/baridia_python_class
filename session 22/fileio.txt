you will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated.
gGo confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined.
thoreauIn the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.
ever let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game. -Babe Ruth
in this life we cannot do great things. We can only do small things with great love.
many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.
you have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes.
you can steer yourself any direction you choose.
you must be the change you wish to see in the world.
do one thing every day that scares you.
